	abstract = {In this paper we present a systematic study of the spatial and temporal effects of intense femtosecond laser pulses in BK-7 over a broad range of input powers, 1–1000 times the critical power for self-focusing (Pcr) by numerically solving the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS). Most numerical studies have not been extended to such high powers. A clear-cut classification of spatio-temporal dynamics up to very high powers into three regimes — the group-velocity dispersion (GVD) regime, the ionization regime and the dominant plasma regime — as done here, is a significant step towards a better understanding. Further, we examine in detail the role of GVD in channel formation by comparing BK-7 to an ‘artificial’ medium. Our investigations bring forth the important observation that diffraction plays a minimal role in the formation of multiple cones and that plasma plays a diffraction-like role at very high powers. A detailed study of the spatio-temporal dynamics in any condensed medium over this range of powers has not been reported hitherto, to the best of our knowledge. We also suggest appropriate operational powers for various applications employing BK-7 on the basis of our results.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to provide practical introduction into numerical modeling of ultrashort optical pulses in extreme nonlinear regimes. The theoretic background section covers derivation of modern pulse propagation models starting from Maxwell’s equations, and includes both envelope-based models and carrier-resolving propagation equations. We then continue with a detailed description of implementation in software of Nonlinear Envelope Equations as an example of a mixed approach which combines finite-difference and spectral techniques. Fully spectral numerical solution methods for the Unidirectional Pulse Propagation Equation are discussed next. The modeling part of this guide concludes with a brief introduction into efficient implementations of nonlinear medium responses. Finally, we include several worked-out simulation examples. These are mini-projects designed to highlight numerical and modeling issues, and to teach numerical-experiment practices. They are also meant to illustrate, first and foremost for a non-specialist, how tools discussed in this guide can be applied in practical numerical modeling.},

The input phase front of the pulse is taken to be parabolic corresponding to focusing/defocusing conditions, while the intensity spatial distribution is Gaussian. The temporal pulse shape is taken to be either sech2(t) or Gaussian type with encoded chirp phase information. We discuss various implications of tightly focused beam on bulk laser ablation (micro-machining) and super continuum (SC) generation. These include blue spectral enhancement of SC with pulse breaking into shorter pulses and detrimental effect of very short pulses on micro-machining.},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {Expressions are obtained for the probability of ionization of atoms and solid bodies in the
field of a strong electromagnetic wave whose frequency is lower than the ionization potential.
In the limiting case of low frequencies these expressions change into the well known formulas
for the probability of tunnel auto-ionization; at high frequencies they describe processes in
which several photons are absorbed simultaneously. The ionization probability has a number
of resonance maxima due to intermediate transition of the atom to an excited state. In the
vicinity of such a maximum the ionization cross section increases by several orders of mag-
nitude. The positions and widths of the resonances depend on the field strength in the wave.
It is shown that for optical frequencies the mechanism under consideration, of direct ioniza-
tion by the wave field, may be significant in the case of electric breakdown in gases, and es-
pecially in condensed media.},
