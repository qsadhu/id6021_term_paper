	Ultrashort pulses have many applications like laser machining, lighting
	control, atmospheric analysis and remote sensing of molecules. To
	study them, first we have to study how their propagation in gasses,
	liquid and condense media works. Otherwise we would not have understand
	of processes that govern spatio-temporal dynamics of ultrashort pulses
	in the medium.

	This paper does its study of propagation of ultrashort pulses in BK7 for
	various input power. We started by introducing Nonlinear Schodinger
	equations (NLS) and adding terms related to optical Kerr effect,
	multiphoton absorption and plasma generation to it.
	Then We identified two important numbers critical power
	($P_{cr}$) and threshold power ($P_{th}$). We used these numbers to
	divide our problem in two regime.
